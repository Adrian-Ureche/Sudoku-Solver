# Sudoku-Solver

Introduction: The document outlines the implementation of an automatic Sudoku solver using computer vision techniques.

Key Components:

Programming Language: Python, chosen for its simplicity and extensive libraries.

Libraries Used: 
    OpenCV for image processing
    Numpy for numerical operations
    Keras for recognizing digits from the Sudoku grid.

Execution:

To run the script, execute the file after ensuring all dependencies (OpenCV, Numpy and Keras) are installed via pip.

Use the command: in the terminal.
